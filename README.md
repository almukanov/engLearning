# engLearning
The main reason why I decided to start writing this project is the desire to improve my English, my vocabulary.
The functionality of the project: 
1) the project parses 10 news items using the API, and the user can select one of them 
2) the user tries to translate the selected news item 
3) the user can compare his translation with the system translation sentence (Google Translate API)
